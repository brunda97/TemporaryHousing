# TemporaryHousing
Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority(LAHSA)and Safe Parking LA (SPLA) are two  organizations  in  Los  Angeles  that  service  the  homeless  community.  LAHSA provides beds in shelters and SPLA manages spaces in parking lots for people living in their cars. In the city’s new app for homelessness, people in need of housing can apply for a space with either service.  For this homework, you will help SPLA choose applicants  that  meet  the  SPLA  specific  requirements  for  the  space  and  that  also optimize the use of the parking lot for that week.Applicantinformation entered into the homelessness app:Applicant ID: 5 digitsGender: M/F/OAge: 0-100Pets: Y/NMedical conditions: Y/NCar: Y/NDriver’s License: Y/NDays of the week needed: 0/1 for each day of the 7 days of the week (Monday-Sunday)
